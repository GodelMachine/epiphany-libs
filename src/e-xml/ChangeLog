	* src/epiphany_xml.cpp (int EpiphanyXML::Parse): Cast
	m_platform->libinitargs to char ** (really should be const, but
	that needs bigger changes).

2014-01-28  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	* src/epiphany_platform.h: Make libinitargs const.

2014-01-12  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	* src/epiphany_platform.h: Add guards against multiple inclusion.
